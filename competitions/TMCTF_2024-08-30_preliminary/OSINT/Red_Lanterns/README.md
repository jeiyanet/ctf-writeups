# Red Lanterns

## Determining the file
The file was opened through the folders by normally opening it.

Doing so, showed an image of a place that had Chinese-esque area.

## The clue
The problem said that the format of the flag was TMCTF{CityName}.

## Where is this place
We looked around the image to know where the place is, then we saw the sign near the stairs, and saw names of places.
